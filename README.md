## Looking for a like-minded collaborator

I’m working on a technically demanding project focused on **private, local-first intelligence systems**.
This is not a startup pitch, not a quick MVP, and not a growth-at-all-costs idea.

The problem space involves:
- privacy-preserving systems
- local / edge intelligence
- security-first architecture
- long-term correctness over short-term hype

I’m not looking for:
- hype builders
- people chasing funding
- “idea people”
- fast timelines or guaranteed outcomes

I *am* looking for someone who:
- enjoys deep technical problems
- thinks independently and critically
- is comfortable working quietly
- values robustness, ethics, and correctness
- understands that meaningful systems take time

At this stage, collaboration would be:
- exploratory
- small in scope
- based on real technical discussion, not promises

If this resonates, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
A good first question is:

**What do you think most people misunderstand about this kind of system?**
